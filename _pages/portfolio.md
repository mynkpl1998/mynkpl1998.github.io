| [Visualizing Deep Learning  Optimization Algorithms](https://github.com/mynkpl1998/Deep-Learning-Optimization-Algorithms) |
| :---- |
| **Description**: Gradient based algorithms is the key to optimize the deep neural networks. Apart from the vanilla gradient descent algorithm, there exists many variant of gradient based algorithms which can  improve the speed of convergence and can avoid local minima too. In this project, various Deep learning optimization algorithmswere studied and their speed of convergence were visualized using PyTorch. Visualization of various deep learning optimization algorithms implemented using PyTorchâ€™s automatic differentiation tool and optimizers. It demonstrates how the iterative methods approaches to the minimum in the case of convex, non-convex surfaces and surfaces with saddle point. <br> **Source Code**: [https://github.com/mynkpl1998/Deep-Learning-Optimization-Algorithms](https://github.com/mynkpl1998/Deep-Learning-Optimization-Algorithms) <br> **Some visualizations**:  <br> ![alt-text-1](https://github.com/mynkpl1998/Deep-Learning-Optimization-Algorithms/raw/master/Images/convex_sgd.gif "SGD on convex-surface") ![alt-text-2](https://github.com/mynkpl1998/Deep-Learning-Optimization-Algorithms/raw/master/Images/non_convex_sgd.gif "SGD on non-convex surface")|


| Recurrent Deep-Q Learning |
| :---- |
| **Description**: Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) is a generalization of Markov Decision Process where agent cannot directly observe the underlying state and only an observation is available. Earlier methods suggests to maintain a belief (a pmf) over all the possible states which encodes the probability of being in each state. This quickly limits the size of the problem to which we can use this method. However, the paper Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning presented an approach which uses last 4 observations as input to the learning algorithm, which can be seen as 4th order markov decision process. Many papers suggest that much performance can be obtained if we use more than last 4 frames but this is expensive from computational and storage point of view (experience replay). Recurrent networks can be used to summarize what agent has seen in past observations. In this project, I investgated this using a simple Partially Observable Environment and found that using a single recurrent layer able to achieve much better performance than using some last k-frames. <br> **Source Code**: [https://github.com/mynkpl1998/Recurrent-Deep-Q-Learning](https://github.com/mynkpl1998/Recurrent-Deep-Q-Learning) <br> **Results**: The figure given below compares the performance of different cases. MDP case is the best we can do as the underlying state is fully visible to the agent. However, the challenge is to perform better given an observation. The graph clearly shows the LSTM consistently performed better as the total reward per episode was much higher than using some last k-frames. <br> <br> ![alt-text-4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mynkpl1998/Recurrent-Deep-Q-Learning/master/data/GIFs/perf.png "Performance difference using LSTM network against past k-frames") |

| Deep learning for Physical layer |
| :---- |
| **Description**: We present and discuss the application of Deep Learning (DL) for the physical layer. By interpreting a communication system as an AutoEncoder, we develop a fundamental new way to think about communications system design as end-to-end reconstruction task that seeks to jointly optimize transmitter and receiver components in a single process.  Simulations were done to illustrate the learning of the deep networks. Further, the results were compared with traditional methods. <br> **Report**: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q3Ba741gZxWAgv4t7ERwb5H93iajp2J-/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q3Ba741gZxWAgv4t7ERwb5H93iajp2J-/view) <br> **Modeling communication system as end-to-end learning system**: <br> <br> ![alt-text-9](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mynkpl1998/mynkpl1998.github.io/master/images/model.jpg "Blocks of a communication system") ![alt-text-10](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mynkpl1998/mynkpl1998.github.io/master/images/arch.jpg "End-to-end learning based model of a communication system")|

| **Description**: This project investigates the opportunities of applying the deep convolutional networks fordeveloping prediction model for cancer prediction. We selected high quality image dataset containing both benign and malignant examples. We build a classifier which used SIFT to extract the features from the images.
