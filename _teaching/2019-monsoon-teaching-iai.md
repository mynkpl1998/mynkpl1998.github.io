### Overview

This course will be project focused hands-on course, and enable students to implement key artificial intelligence techniques on heterogeneous computing platforms.

Heterogeneous computing platforms consist of different kind of processing elements, e.g. CPU, GPU, FPGA, DSP. We will focus on the following types of computing platforms in this course.
1. Platforms consisting of CPU and GPU computing elements, e.g. your mobile phone, laptop or a server. 
2. Platforms consisting of CPU and FPGA reconfigurable computing fabric, e.g. Xilinx/Intel Altera based SoCs. We will use Xilinx SDSoC development tools in this course.
